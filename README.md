# lara-react

Lara-react is just a way i found to use laravel with react js in a easy way. You are free to use this code in your projects or make it better.

# Setting up

``` git clone https://github.com/namadnuno/lara-react.git ```

``` cd lara-react ```

``` cp .env.example .env ```

``` composer install ```

``` php artisan key:generate ```

``` npm install ```

``` npm run dev ```

That's it!
